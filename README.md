# ABC+XYZ Analysis for FMCG Client Segmentation

This project provides an extended ABC+XYZ analysis aimed at segmenting clients of an FMCG company based on their purchasing behavior. The segmentation is performed using two key sales metrics: **Net Sales Value (NSV)** and **Volume (in tons)**. This dual-metric approach offers deeper insights into client importance and demand predictability, enabling the development of flexible, region-specific business strategies.

## ðŸ§© Project Objectives

- Segment FMCG clients by **importance (ABC)** and **demand volatility (XYZ)**
- Perform analysis **per region**, considering that some clients operate locally rather than nationally
- Compare segmentation results by **NSV** and **volume**, providing multiple perspectives
- Support sales and partner management teams in tailoring **commercial strategies** by segment

---

## ðŸ“… Data Overview

- **Period:** Q2â€“Q3 2025
- **Granularity:** Client-level sales by region
- **Metrics used:**
  - **NSV** â€“ net sales value in monetary terms
  - **Volume** â€“ sales in physical tons

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

1. **ABC Analysis** â€“ categorizes clients based on cumulative contribution to total sales.
2. **XYZ Analysis** â€“ evaluates the stability of client demand using the coefficient of variation.
3. **Regional Segmentation** â€“ matrices are built for each region to reflect local client behavior.

Combining both analyses results in a **9-cell ABC+XYZ matrix** per region, allowing:
- Prioritization of key accounts
- Identification of clients with unstable or low-volume purchases
- Strategy adjustments for regional sales teams

---

## ðŸ“Š Outputs

- ABC+XYZ matrices for each region (by NSV and volume)
- Visual summaries of client distribution across categories
- Strategic recommendations per segment (not in code â€” to be used by commercial teams)
